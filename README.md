# art management program
a python GUI program to manage a artists or photographers work

this program helps artists and fotographers manage a file system that contains pictures of finished works, and data about these works. it uses python 3.5 and wxPython 4.0 to create a gui interface that makes management of the system easy and straightforward.

every artist needs a file system to manage photographs of their work, data about their works (size, materials, descriptions, dates prices galleries etc) and to create catalogs ( here in pdf format) for distrbution to fans, galleries and interested parties.  this program automates the whole process,savng the artist many hours of tedious work that isnt really art related.

as of 11 January 2020 this program has basic functionality. you can 
   create databases 
   create new paintings (ie a json file which displays on the screen the data about the painting)
   store data about the paintings in json files
   scroll thru your collection of data
   sort fotos into folders based on type ( basic level of sorting)
   organize paintings into sub catagories
   
   still to do:
   
   set the system up to display a foto of your painting with the data
   create odt text documents from the data at the press of a button (info sheet on each painting)
   create pdfs from the odt sheet
   
   possibly in the future
   
   system that automatically prodces catalogs of work as set up by the artist for shows, fairs advertising etc.
   
   
   if anyone would like to help, im planning on releasing this to the pypl repository in a few weeks when i get some more functionality in , as a shareware/ freeware software tool for artists. im looking for people to help with writing the program, documentation, and suggesting new features etc. you can contact me here if you are interested.
