art management program

NOTE: this is still in development. As an assist to all possible developers, I have included all files that I have created in the debian package.NOTE: this is still in development. As an assist to all possible developers, I have included all files that I have created in the debian package.  

a python GUI program to manage a artists or photographers work / protfolio of work and data that goes with it. 

this program helps artists and fotographers manage a file system that contains pictures of finished works, and data about these works. it uses python 3.5 and wxPython 4.0 to create a gui interface that makes management of the system easy and straightforward.

every artist needs a file system to manage photographs of their work, data about their works (size, materials, descriptions, dates prices galleries etc) and to create catalogs ( here in pdf format) for distrbution to fans, galleries and interested parties.  this program automates the whole process,savng the artist many hours of tedious work that isnt really art related.

as of 18 January 2020 this program has basic functionality. you can

   create databases 
   
   create new paintings (ie a json file which displays on the screen the data about the painting)
   
   store data about the paintings in json files
   
   scroll thru your collection of data
   
   sort fotos into folders based on type ( basic level of sorting)
   
   organize paintings into sub catagories
  
   set the system up to display a foto of your painting with the data
   
   create pdfs from the .md sheet
   
   
still to do:
   
   create a method that automatically does file system set up for the user
    
   change output directory of pdf to painting.info
   
possibly in the future:
   
   system that automatically prodces catalogs of work as set up by the artist for shows, fairs advertising etc.
   
   right now, 18 jan 2020 I am using the program and debuging it, I hope to release it as a python PyPl program by feb 1 2020, so that others can use it as well.
   
   if anyone would like to help, im planning on releasing this to the pypl repository in a few weeks when i get some more functionality in , as a shareware/ freeware software tool for artists. im looking for people to help with writing the program, documentation, and suggesting new features etc. you can contact me here if you are interested.
